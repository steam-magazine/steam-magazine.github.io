                <h1>Is the iPhone 5c Worth it?</h1>
                <h2>By Jash Gada</h2>
                <p>
                    When Apple released the iPhone 5c on September 10, 2013, it was a total disappointment. Apple ditched the high quality glass and aluminum body and brought in the same polycarbonate body as the iPhone 3gs did. That is a quite old body. Apple's phones are known for being elegant and made of long lasting material, which is a factor that makes iPhones worth it even with their high pricing. On the other hand, the 5c is made out of cheap material, but its price is still quite high. Let's compare the not obvious differences between the iPhone 5c and 5s...

                <h1>Hunting Differences Between Owls and Hawks</h1>
                <h2>By Amanda Chou</h2>
                <p>
                    A brown squirrel scrambles up a tree, searching nuts to eat. Suddenly, an owl swoops down a tree branch and scoops up the squirrel with its talons. The owl breaks the squirrel's neck and tears it into tiny pieces. The hungry owl enjoys its delicious dinner and continues its search for other prey. Owls have many similarities, differences, and special characteristics in comparison to hawks when it comes to hunting.

                <p>
                    This type of Lego is neither the one you play when you are young nor the one you build something up and place it on the window sill like a decoration. This type of Lego is Lego Mindstorms EV3. Obviously, it is a kind of toy! It is the best version among the Lego products because it has things the other version does not .such as having bigger memory than other versions.

                <h2>By Riya Shrivastava</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever spent 15 minutes just sitting down, idle,  slowing down your jumbled thoughts? How was it? Well, some (or most) people really don't like to be alone with their thoughts. In fact, people taking part in one new study by Timothy Wilson, a psychologist at the University of Virginia, chose to receive an electric shock rather than spend 15 minutes alone in a room with nothing to do.

                <h2>By Chinmay Lalgudi</h2>
                <p>
                    Familial Hypercholesterolemia is a disease characterized by high levels of cholesterol in your body, specifically low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This "bad" type of cholesterol gets into your bloodstream and causes early cardiovascular diseases. More than 34 million American adults have elevated blood cholesterol levels, and the most common inherited form of it, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, occurs in 1 in every 500 people in most country on average, but is most common in populations including Afrikaners in South Africa, French Canadians, Lebanese, and Finns.

                <h1>Teleportation: Will it ever happen?</h1>
                <h2>By Esha Umbarkar</h2>
                <p>
                    Do you ever wonder what it would be like to teleport? To arrive anywhere in the world in just seconds? Well, scientists are working on it right now. The idea of teleportation has been used in many science fiction books and films, but now it has been pulled into the real world. Physicists are focusing on something known as “quantum teleportation”, which is the transfer of information rather than matter.

                <p>
                    "It is... interesting that the material can absorb and release oxygen many times without losing the ability. It is like dipping a sponge in water, squeezing the water out of it and repeating the process over and over again," says Professor Christine McKenzie of the University of Southern Denmark. She and postdoc Jonas Sundberg have created a type of crystal that can extract the oxygen out of the air and release it again.

                <h1>Tesla Motors</h1>
                <h2>By Vivek Iyer</h2>
                <p>
                    Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, started the company in 2003. The first car Tesla ever produced was the Tesla Roadster, a fully electric car. It can go 245 miles on a full charge and can go from 0 miles to 60 miles in 3.7 seconds! Prototypes were first introduced to the public in July of 2006. The batteries inside of the roadster come from 20 years of advancement for lithium-ion battery technology. The battery pack carries 6,831 lithium-ion cells which makes it the most energy dense pack in the industry. These cells may lead to longer battery life. With the high-powered wall connecter, a roadster charges in four hours.The body is made of carbon fiber, making it lighter than if it had used steel. This helps since lighter cars are generally quicker and easier to handle than normal cars. Now, Tesla has stopped producing this car because they wanted to focus on the Model S, and you can only buy used roadsters.
