                <h1>Is the iPhone 5c Worth it?</h1>
                <h2>By Jash Gada</h2>
                <p>
                    When Apple released the iPhone 5c on September 10, 2013, it was a total disappointment. Apple ditched the high quality glass and aluminum body and brought in the same polycarbonate body as the iPhone 3gs did. That is a quite old body. Apple's phones are known for being elegant and made of long lasting material, which is a factor that makes iPhones worth it even with their high pricing. On the other hand, the 5c is made out of cheap material, but its price is still quite high. Let's compare the not obvious differences between the iPhone 5c and 5s...

                    A brown squirrel scrambles up a tree, searching nuts to eat. Suddenly, an owl swoops down a tree branch and scoops up the squirrel with its talons. The owl breaks the squirrel's neck and tears it into tiny pieces. The hungry owl enjoys its delicious dinner and continues its search for other prey. Owls have many similarities, differences, and special characteristics in comparison to hawks when it comes to hunting.

                    This type of Lego is neither the one you play when you are young nor the one you build something up and place it on the window sill like a decoration. This type of Lego is Lego Mindstorms EV3. Obviously, it is a kind of toy! It is the best version among the Lego products because it has things the other version does not .such as having bigger memory than other versions.
