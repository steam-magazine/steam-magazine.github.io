    <h1>SuperTrucks</h1>

        The SuperTruck program is an initiative by the U.S. Department of Energy, started in 2010. Its goal is to reduce the amount of gas that tractor trailers use. Even though big rigs only make up 4% of the vehicles on the road, they use 20% of the total transportation fuel consumed. Its goal was to increase freight efficiency by 50% by 2015, and then commercialize these improvements by 2020. The Department of Energy issued four grants to Daimler, Volvo, Navistar, and partners Cummins and Peterbilt. These companies together make up more that 75% of the Class 8 market in the United States. The Class 8 truck rating is composed of anything with a gross weight of over 33,000 lbs, which includes most tractor trailers. The grants amounted to a total of $138 million dollars. In addition to these government funds, each company matched it with an equal investment of their own.

        These trucks use several technologies in order to become more efficient. One example is converting excess exhaust heat into power delivered to the crankshaft. It works by placing a metal-plated thermoelectric generator around the exhaust pipe. This reduces the load on the alternator. According to John Davis of the Cummins-Peterbilt group, “The most obvious improvements on each truck are the aerodynamic aids. Extensive wind tunnel testing has found ways to … improve airflow around the rig.” The Navistar group has made improvements such as substituting rearview cameras for mirrors, a steeply raked windscreen, wheel skirts, and low-rolling resistance tires. These changes and more reduce aerodynamic drag by 42%, which results to a 21% improvement in freight efficiency. In addition to aerodynamic developments, the Navistar group has also developed a predictive cruise control system. This system uses a mixture of map altitude data and GPS technology to predict upcoming hills and valleys. According to William de Ojeda, this system is predicted to improve fuel economy by 3 to 10%. De Ojeda is an expert on SuperTrucks and has presented at the U.S. Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Office in May 2013.

        Currently, Cummins-Peterbilt is the only company with fully functioning demonstration vehicle. In a test of one of these trucks, it averaged 9.9 mpg over more than 11,000 miles, peaking at 10.7 mpg. This is a huge improvement from normal tractor trailers, which get around 5.8 miles per gallon. For a truck that is driven 120,000 miles per year, it would save around $27,000 per year in diesel fuel costs.
        <br/><br/>
        There are several challenges to implementing these advancements, as there are whenever groundbreaking changes like these are made. The ICCT (The International Council on Clean Transportation) conducted interviews with three of the SuperTruck teams, and here are some of barriers that they foresee. For example, the wheel and trailer skirts add extra weight. In order to make sure that the total payload capabilities of the trucks are not affected, overall vehicle weight needs to be reduced so that the benefits are not neutralized. In addition to adding weight, the skirts make mechanical inspection of tires and drivetrain more difficult. Driver acceptance of more advanced transmissions and engines is also an issue.
        <br/><br/>
        If all trailer tractors in the U.S. were SuperTrucks, they combined would consume 300 million fewer barrels of oil and save $30 billion less on diesel fuel per year. It would also reduce greenhouse gases by 35% for each truck. Currently, the use of these technologies is not widespread. In the future, however, you may one day find yourself on the highway driving next to a SuperTruck.
