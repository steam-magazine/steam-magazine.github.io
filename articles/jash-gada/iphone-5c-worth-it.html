    <h1>Is the iPhone 5c Worth it?</h1>
    <h2>By Jash Gada</h2>

        When Apple released the iPhone 5c on September 10, 2013, it was a total disappointment. Apple ditched the high quality glass and aluminum body and brought in the same polycarbonate body as the iPhone 3gs did. That is a quite old body. Apple’s phones are known for being elegant and made of long lasting material, which is a factor that makes iPhones worth it even with their high pricing. On the other hand, the 5c is made out of cheap material, but its price is still quite high. Let’s compare the not obvious differences between the iPhone 5c and 5s. On an iPhone 5s, you have the amazing fingerprint scanner with Touch ID. But, this feature is not available on the 5c. Another feature the 5c is missing are additional features in the camera like dual-flash, slow motion, and bursts. Also, the 5s can be bought with up to 64 gigabytes of storage while the 5c stops at 32 gb. So for those people who want phones with lots of storage, they can rule the 5c off their list. The iPhone 5s has an A7 chip while the iPhone 5c has an A6 chip.

        In terms of pricing, the iPhone 5c costs $560 for 16 gigabytes as an unlocked phone. Most people do buy 16 gigabyte phones and the Samsung Galaxy S5 costs $599.99 for that but has it’s maximum features. You could get the iPhone 6 for $650 (still quite costly) unlocked with 16 gigabytes of storage. A 32 gb model of the 5c costs $650. The cheaper pricing is not worth it due to the loss of many features like mentioned earlier. The one thing that fooled people to buy this was the variety of colors it came in like green, blue, yellow, pink, and white. Besides, Apple may make these odd colors sound cool but when you hit reality they aren’t. Some people may still want these colors though because they could find them cool. Those who do like them could just buy a case instead with any color of their choice and that would be protective too. So if you are planning on buying the 5c, you might want to put some thought on it before doing so.
