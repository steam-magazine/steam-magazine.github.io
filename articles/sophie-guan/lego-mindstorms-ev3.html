        This type of Lego is neither the one you play when you are young nor the one you build something up and place it on the window sill like a decoration. This type of Lego is Lego Mindstorms EV3. Obviously, it is a kind of toy! It is the best version among the Lego products because it has things the other version does not .such as having bigger memory than other versions.
        <br/><br/>
        Lego Mindstorms EV3 was developed in January 4, 2013. It was published by the Lego Company. Even though it is the best version, you still have to build something out of the pile of pieces first. Lego Mindstorms EV3 has a brick whose function is similar to a computer. The brick is attached to the pieces you build. The brick's function is to command the motors and other sensors to function. Lego Mindstorms has a different type-in language. The language is easier to understand and program than the other kind of computer language. For example, it is a lot easier than JavaScript (a commonly used computer language) because Lego's language is basically a bunch of "trucks" connect together. Lego Mindstorms EV3 could do a lot of things, like moving, talking, and detecting barrier in front of it. It uses motors that connect to the brick to move. You could use the EV3 language to command it through the brick. The best part is that Lego Mindstorms EV3's shape could be anything, like a printer, a robot, a dinosaur, or even a game player! Its shapes are not so simple. There are a lot steps to complete if you want to build something. With different shapes, it could do different things. For example, in the form of a robot, it could shoot balls out of a "gun" on its hand or spin swords. Each form has its own abilities and could have one or more abilities.

        I have used Lego mindstorms EV3 before. The trick is not how to build the thing. It is how to program it. I have a hard time trying to figure out what button goes with what functionâ€¦ Lego Mindstorms EV3 is pretty cool and has special abilities. What are you staring at, try it out!
