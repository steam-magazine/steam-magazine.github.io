    <h1>Tesla Motors</h1>
    <h2>By Vivek Iyer</h2>
    <p style="width:80%; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;">
        Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, started the company in 2003. The first car Tesla ever produced was the Tesla Roadster, a fully electric car. It can go 245 miles on a full charge and can go from 0 miles to 60 miles in 3.7 seconds! Prototypes were first introduced to the public in July of 2006. The batteries inside of the roadster come from 20 years of advancement for lithium-ion battery technology. The battery pack carries 6,831 lithium-ion cells which makes it the most energy dense pack in the industry. These cells may lead to longer battery life. With the high-powered wall connecter, a roadster charges in four hours.The body is made of carbon fiber, making it lighter than if it had used steel. This helps since lighter cars are generally quicker and easier to handle than normal cars. Now, Tesla has stopped producing this car because they wanted to focus on the Model S, and you can only buy used roadsters.

           After the massive impact of launching the Roadster, Elon Musk and the rest of his company created another car, which made a colossal impact, the Tesla Model S. This automobile was fully electric as well. There are many features like the dual motor. On the P85D (Performance 85 kilo-watt dual motor) the time it takes to go from 0 miles to 60 miles is only 3.2 seconds! The range is 275 miles for a full charge, which is 10 more miles than a Model S with the dual motor in it. Its cost ranges from $61,070 to as high as $146,470 before any federal or state tax credits. Other features include the carbon fiber spoiler, the tech package, smart-air suspension, the premium interior package, the ultra-high fidelity sound, retractable door handles, and many more.

    Soon, Tesla will release the Tesla Model X, a SUV with the lowest center of gravity of any SUV. Its performance version can make it accelerate 0 miles to 60 miles in less than five seconds. It has falcon wings, (special doors that look like falcon wings if you open them up) and many more features. This car is only taking reservations right now, and it will come out in 2015. This car does not have a price tag on it yet, but it will be costly. The Roadster, Model S, and Model X are expensive luxury models so Tesla is planning to manufacture an affordable, mass produced car, the Model E.
