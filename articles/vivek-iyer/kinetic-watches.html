        Seiko, a large watch producing company, first introduced a kinetic watch in Germany, 1988, and it was called Auto-quartz. Only in 1997, did Seiko rename it the kinetic watch. Kinetic watches transform kinetic energy into electrical energy. These watches are very popular at this time since they are do not require batteries, making the watches very environmentally friendly. Kinetic watches use the ownerâ€™s own movement to keep itself on. If one does not use them much, watch winders can make them continue to have power. One watch winder can give power to multiple watches at once.  Many newer watches can store energy for several months as well. These watches come in all shapes and sizes from a variety of manufacturers. Most kinetic watches also have an indicator to tell you how much power is stored inside of them. They have sensors that tell the owner if their watch has been inactive for 24 hours. If so, the watch will put itself to sleep, and the wearer will need to shake it to start it again, and it will automatically reset the time and date. Certain kinetic watches can restart even if they have not been used for more than a year! A kinetic watch is as durable as any other type of watch.

 Problems with the watch include, sometimes these watches will omit, needing a tune-up, as they may be off by a couple of minutes. Seiko has had problems with the capacitors, (a device that stores energy), so they have substituted it with a titanium lithium ion cell instead. As shown, the capitator is one of the main problems of buying a kinetic watch, showing that kinetic watches are not all about great things. Also, if you do not wear them for some time they will stop working and you will have to wind them up. Adding on to that, it is sometimes hard to open the back of the watch (inside the back of the watch is the capitator or titanium lithium-ion cell). The cell that Seiko puts in is not a normal battery, and it is a little hard to find (look online to buy one).
